Didn't get windows 10 to virtualize.  Saving this file for completeness.


I. Verify windows version.  The SOA OIT DNR workstation is running
64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise:

  1. Winkey + S - search for control panel
  2. Open system
  3. Observe
     windows edition:        Windows 10 Enterprise
     processor:              Intel Core i7-6700 cpu 3.40Ghz 3.41GHz
     installed memory (RAM): 16.0GB (15.9 usable)
     system type:            64-bit operating system, x64-based processor


II. Enable virtualization in bios.  On Dell Optiplex 7040 rebooted and
held down F2 to get into bios.  Found:

Virtualization
x Enable Intel Virtualization Technology
x Enable VT fir Direct I/O

Virualization settings in bios good by default

III. Setting up Hyper-V
1. Search for Control Panel
2. Open Programs and Features
  click Turn Windows features on or off (upper left)

3. At Windows Feature popup window select Hyper-V and all subitems:
x Hyper-V
  x Hyper-V Management Tools
    x Hyper-V GUI Management TOols
    x Hyper-V Module for Windows PowerShell
  x Hyper-V Platform
    Hyper-V Hypervisor
    Hyper-V Services

This configuration will install and configure Hyper-V then confirm changes
and restart.
